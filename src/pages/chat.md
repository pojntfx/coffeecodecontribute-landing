# Chat

We use IRC and GitLab's issues for communication. While GitLab's issues are available in the individual repositories, you can use an IRC client for direct communication or if you simply have a question. To connect, consider using one of the following clients:

- [Freenode's default web client](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23coffeecodecontribute)
- [KiwiIRC modern web client](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/)
- [Awesome native Linux client (Polari)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Polari)

Use the following connection data:

| Key     | Value                 |
| ------- | --------------------- |
| Server  | freenode.net          |
| Channel | #coffeecodecontribute |

Please be nice to each other and consider reading our [Code of Conduct](/culture) first!
